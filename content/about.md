## About me

I am a Third year undergraduate at Imperial College London studying Electronics and Information engineering (Computer engineering) who loves all things computer / technology related. Within my degree I have study various fields of electrical engineering, math and software engineering, with a special focus on hardware design. Over the course of several projects and years of tinkering I have had the pleasure of working with a diverse array of technologies ranging from customisable hardware design using templated verilog, old school scripting languages like Bash and Perl, and languages allowing the development of highly performant software by providing close control of the underlying hardware like Rust and C, to the infinitely customizable GNU/Linux ecosystem, various web frameworks, and various tools for vulnerability analysis including fuzzers, debuggers and decompilers. Outside of my passion for engineering, I am a cycling enthusiast, casual runner, chess player and a generally social person.

## About this site

Currently this site, as most pet projects tend to be, is still a work in progress, but I plan on using it to showcase some CTF write-ups, share random cool engineering related things and sharing further details on the projects I've been working on.
