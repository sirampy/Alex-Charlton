## About the project

The purpouse of this project was to develop a system that combined FPGA and cloud technologies to create an interesting software system. As part of the project we wrote a report linked [here](report.pdf) detailing the system architecture and some of the decision making processes. I have summarised it on my [projects page](../) if you want a more brief outline.

## Ok, so here's what I did

A couple of my group mates, including myself, decided that this project would be a good opportunity to explore a new (to us) programming language, so after hearing about this trendy new language called rust, we decided to give it a go. After coming up with a rough outline of the system architecture we were aiming to build, I decided to take on the task of building the game, seeming as it seemed like a decent, simple project to learn a new language with. After creating a base game, I collaborated with my teammates to iteratively build on our MVP, building new features into the client and server. Toward the end of the project, I lead the development of the lobby system as I wanted to brush up on my SQL skills.
