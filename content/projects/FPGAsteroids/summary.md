I worked in a team of 5 to develop a cloud hosted, multiplayer Asteroids game, using an FPGA dev-kit as a controller. I took this project as an opportunity to learn Rust, using it for the majority of the server logic. We used an FPGA dev-kit running a Kalman filter on gyroscope and accelerometer data as a video-game controller. The client was a multithreaded python project comprised of a graphical interface based on the OpenGL wrapper [RayLib](https://www.raylib.com/), a text based interface for the lobby system, an interface with the FPGA controller, and of course some netcode to interface with the server. The server ran on multithreaded rust, capable of hosting several games simultaneously whilst providing an SQLite powered lobby system, allowing players to easily co-ordinate matches and track their performance.

The system is very performant, with RayLib's efficient rendering generating 3700 fps on a desktop with a midrange GPU, tick-rate and net-code creating an unnoticeable 55ms delay, and the rust server being able to handle 2000+ lobbies at 25% CPU usage, limited by Linux kernel restrictions. This performance lead to our project receiving a grade of 78.4%.
