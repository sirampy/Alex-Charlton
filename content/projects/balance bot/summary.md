I worked in a team of 6 to design a self-balancing maze solving Robot. The firmware was developed with [zephyr RTOS](https://zephyrproject.org/), providing a multithreaded environment, whilst not sacrificing low level control of the hardware. The firmware communicated over UART with a raspberry pi running an increadibly lightweight install of [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/), hosting a rust server that used the async rust based [capnproto rpc](https://capnproto.org/rpc.html) implementation, providing an interface for the rust egui based client.  
The system was highly performant despite it's complexity, featuring complex control, maze solving and networking modules resulting in our team receiving the runner up prize for best end of year project.
